<!-- When making responsive web pages, add the following <meta> element in all your web pages: -->
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

    <!-- Responsive Web Design is about using HTML and CSS 
        to automatically resize, hide, shrink, 
        or enlarge, a website, to make it look good on all 
        devices (desktops, tablets, and phones): -->

    <h2>Setting the Viewport</h2>
    <p>This example does not really do anything, other than showing you how to add the viewport meta element.</p>

    <!-- Using the width Property
If the CSS width property is set to 100%, the image will be responsive and scale up and down: -->

    <p>When the CSS width property is set in a percentage value, the image will scale up and down when resizing the browser
        window. Resize the browser window to see the effect.</p>

    <!-- If the max-width property is set to 100%, the image will scale down if it has to, but never scale up to be larger than its original size: -->
    <img src="https://www.w3schools.com/html/img_girl.jpg" style="width:100%;">

    <!-- The text size can be set with a "vw" unit, which means the "viewport width".

That way the text size will follow the size of the browser window: -->

    <h1 style="font-size:10vw;">Responsive Text</h1>

    <p style="font-size:5vw;">Resize the browser window to see how the text size scales.</p>

    <p style="font-size:5vw;">Use the "vw" unit when sizing the text. 10vw will set the size to 10% of the viewport width.</p>

    <p>Viewport is the browser window size. 1vw = 1% of viewport width. If the viewport is 50cm wide, 1vw is 0.5cm.</p>
