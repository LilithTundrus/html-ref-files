    <!-- A file path describes the location of a file in a web site's folder structure.

File paths are used when linking to external files like:

Web pages
Images
Style sheets
JavaScripts -->

    <!-- An absolute file path is the full URL to an internet file: -->
    <h2>Using a Full URL File Path</h2>
    <img src="https://www.w3schools.com/images/picture.jpg" alt="Mountain" style="width:300px">

    <!-- A relative file path points to a file relative to the current page. -->

    <img src="/images/picture.jpg" alt="Mountain">

<!-- In this example, the file path points to a file in the images folder located in the folder one level above the current folder: -->

<img src="../images/picture.jpg" alt="Mountain">

<!-- It is best practice to use relative file paths (if possible).

When using relative file paths, 
your web pages will not be bound to your 
current base URL. All links will work on your own computer 
(localhost) as well as on your current public domain and 
your future public domains.  -->
